Case Study: Analyzing Car Mileage with Probability Distributions in R

You work for an automobile manufacturer, and your task is to analyze the fuel efficiency of a specific car model. Understanding the distribution of car mileage is important for marketing and performance evaluation.



Tasks:

1. Load the "mtcars" dataset from R's inbuilt datasets.

2. Extract the column containing car mileage (mpg) from the dataset.

3. Calculate the descriptive statistics for the car mileage, including the mean and standard deviation.

4. Visualize the data using a histogram to get an initial understanding of the distribution of car mileage.

5. Fit different probability distributions (e.g., Normal, Binomial etc)

6. Select and justify the best-fitting probability distribution for car mileage based on the analysis.

7. Calculate the probability of a car having a mileage below 20 mpg using the selected distribution.

8. Discuss how this analysis can be used for marketing and performance evaluation of the car model.

ANSWERS
Here are the steps to complete the tasks:

To load the “mtcars” dataset, use the following command: data(mtcars). This will load the dataset into your R environment.

To extract the column containing car mileage (mpg), use the following command: mpg <- mtcars$mpg.

To calculate the descriptive statistics for the car mileage, including the mean and standard deviation, use the following command: mean_mpg <- mean(mpg) and sd_mpg <- sd(mpg).

To visualize the data using a histogram, use the following command: hist(mpg).

To fit different probability distributions, use the fitdistr function from the MASS package. For example, to fit a normal distribution, use the following command: fit_norm <- fitdistr(mpg, "normal").

To select and justify the best-fitting probability distribution for car mileage based on the analysis, you can compare the goodness of fit of different distributions using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The distribution with the lowest AIC or BIC value is considered the best fit. You can use the AIC and BIC functions in R to calculate these values for different distributions.

To calculate the probability of a car having a mileage below 20 mpg using the selected distribution, use the pnorm function in R. For example, if the selected distribution is normal, use the following command: pnorm(20, mean = fit_norm$estimate[1], sd = fit_norm$estimate[2]).

This analysis can be used for marketing and performance evaluation of the car model. By understanding the distribution of car mileage, you can identify the target market for the car model and optimize the marketing strategy accordingly. Additionally, by selecting the best-fitting probability distribution, you can make more accurate predictions about the car’s fuel efficiency and performance, which can inform the design and manufacturing process.
